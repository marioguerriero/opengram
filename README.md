[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marioguerriero/opengram.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/marioguerriero/opengram)

Just a personal attempt to replicate an Instragram like open source social network which features server side DOM rendering using React.

# Usage
You should have a node interpeter and mongodb installed on your system in order to test this project with the following steps:
* `git clone https://github.com/marioguerriero/social-network`
* `cd social-network`
* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* You will see a message like `Server listening on port PORT`
* Now perform an HTTP GET request to http://localhost:PORT to use it

# Used technologies
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Express](expressjs.com/)
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/)
* [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)

And much more...
